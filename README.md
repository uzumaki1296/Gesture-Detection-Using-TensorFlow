# Gesture-Detection-Using-TensorFlow


- Built a machine learning model using TensorFlow's convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture to recognize 4 hand gestures from video input leading to an accuracy by almost 93%.
- Trained the CNN model to extract features from the images, classify the gestures into different categories and utilized open-source libraries like OpenCV for capturing and preprocessing the video input to approximately 70% as compared to real-time.
